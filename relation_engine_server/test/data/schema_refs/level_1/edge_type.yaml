title: Edge Type
description: Edge types in Dan Jacobson Exascale dataset
type: string
oneOf:
  - const: domain_co_occur
    description: A layer of protein domain co-occurrence values from the Arabidopsis AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were calculated from weighted mutual information scores to normalize the data for comparison across studies and different types of data layers (Lee et al, 2015).
  - const: gene_coexpr
    description: A subset of pairwise gene coexpression values from the Arabidopsis AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were
      calculated from Pearson correlation coefficients to normalize the data
      for comparison across studies and different types of data layers (Lee et
      al, 2015).
  - const: pheno_assn
    description: GWAS associations produced by analyzing a subset of phenotypes and SNPs in the Arabidopsis 1001 Genomes database. Edge values are significant association scores after FDR correction.
  - const: ppi_hithru
    description: Log likelihood score. A layer of protein-protein interaction values derived from four high-throughput PPI screening experiments; from the Arabidopsis AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were calculated to normalize the data for comparison across studies and different types of data layers (Lee et al, 2015).
  - const: ppi_liter
    description: A layer of protein-protein interaction values from literature-curated small- to medium-scale experimental data; from the Arabidopsis AraNetv2 database. The LLS scores that serve as edge values were calculated to normalize the data for comparison across studies and different types of data layers (Lee et al, 2015).
