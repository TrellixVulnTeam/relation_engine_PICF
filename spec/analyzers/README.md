# Analyzers

These are json files for Arango analyzers. The data in them is used by the [Relation Engine API](https://github.com/kbase/relation_engine) to create views via the `POST /_api/analyzer` endpoint of the ArangoDB HTTP interface. Please [see the ArangoDB docs](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/3.5/http/analyzers.html) for the full set of parameters available.
