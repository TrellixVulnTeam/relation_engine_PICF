# Relation Engine Views

Views are templated AQL queries that fetch data from the database.

Variables in views are prefixed with `@`.

## Required format

Each view file should have a set of comments at the top describing the purpose of the query.

## Using views from the API

See the [API docs]() to see how to run these queries using the API.
